/*Problem 4 — “Find the Kth Largest Element (without sorting)”

Description: Given an integer array and an integer k, find the kth largest distinct element in the array. If there are fewer than k distinct elements, print a clear message.

Example:
Input: arr = {7, 4, 6, 3, 9, 1, 2, 10, 10}, k = 3
Distinct sorted descending → {10, 9, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1}
Output: 3rd largest distinct = 7*/
